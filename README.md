# webpack-alf
A simple webpack configuration helper

- is easy, clean and small
- makes it easy to init a webpack configuration
- supports basic configuration options like: adding dependencies to webpack, defining an entry point and output
- supports exteding a configuration by: adding webpack-dev-server, configuring hot reload, configuring basic modules and plugins
